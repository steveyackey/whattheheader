# What the header!?!

Super simple docker image for checking headers. 

Go version is available to run with `steveyackey/whattheheader:latest`
More info on the go version is available in the `go-stdlib` folder.

Originally written to test some weird header issues between a load balancer and ingress controller, but has turned into a fun experiment of reimplimenting hacky versions in different languages/frameworks.
